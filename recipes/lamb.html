                    </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend the pesto ingredients together until smooth in a food processor and place to one side.</li> 
            <li>Then, for the tapenade, simply pulse the olives and oil together in blender until smooth but with a little texture remaining, then set to one side</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/Gas mark 6. In a large hot sauté pan, place a tablespoon of olive oil and then the seasoned lamb racks, fat side down.</li> 
            <li>Allow to colour well and then turn over and colour all sides evenly. Return to being fat side down and place in the hot oven for 12–15 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Remove from the oven and rest, reserving any resting juices to drizzle over before serving.</li>
            <li>While the lamb cooks, prepare the chargrilled vegetables. In a small pan warm 30ml of the olive with the garlic and thyme until it starts to sizzle.</li> 
            <li>Remove from the heat and season with salt. Toss the vegetables with the remaining olive oil and season. In a very hot chargrill pan sear them until cooked.</li>
            <li>Cut into small pieces and place in the flavoured oil to marinade.</li>
            <li>To serve, place a pool of the pesto to one side of the serving plate and a quenelle of the tapenade on the other.</li>
            <li>Reheat the vegetables in the oven and place over the pesto. Carve each rack in half and drizzle with some of the resting juices.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
