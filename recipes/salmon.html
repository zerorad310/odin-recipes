                    </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the pickling liquor for the shallots, peel and finely slice the shallot and garlic, place all of the ingredients into a small pan and bring to the boil. </li> 
            <li>Once boiling, remove from the heat and allow to infuse for a minimum of 30 minutes, or, preferably, overnight. Strain through a sieve, reserving the liquor.</li>
            <li>2-3 hours before serving, peel the banana shallots and slice into 1-2cm thick cylinders.</li> 
            <li>Bring the water and salt to the boil in a pan, then blanch the shallots for 1-2 minutes, so they retain a little bite. </li> 
            <li>Remove from the water and place straight into the pickling liquor until required</li>
            <li>To prepare the tomatoes, brush a reasonably large baking tray with half of the oil then sprinkle with half of the salt. </li> 
            <li>Crush the clove of garlic and rub all over the tray, allowing the garlic to break down and flavour the oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Tear the basil leaves and rub into the tray.</li>
            <li>Slice the tomatoes into different shapes and place onto the seasoned tray, removing a few sections of the tomato seeds for presentation. </li>
            <li>Brush the tomatoes with the remaining oil and season with the salt, sugar and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Cover the tray with cling film and leave at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes before using.</li>
            <li>To prepare the salmon, divide the fillet into 4 equally-weighted portions and place skin-side down onto clean kitchen towel or J-cloth until ready to pan-fry.</li>
            <li>Place a large frying pan over a medium heat. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper and add the oil to the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add the salmon skin-side down and cook to halfway through each fillet, then turn over and remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>The residual heat of the pan should cook the fish through.</li>
            <li>Place the tomatoes onto plates, followed by the drained shallot cylinders.</li>
            <li>Squeeze a little lemon juice over the cooked fish and serve alongside the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Add the chives to the pan and drizzle the pan juice and chives over the salmon and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with the pink-stem micro herbs and tomato seeds before serving.</li>
